Description: char *get_next_line(int fd)
get_next_line is used to get the next line from the file given, and it'll keep printing the next line from the file until it reaches either the end of file (EOF) or '\0'. It'll print the first line until it reaches the '\n', if not EOF, then it returns the output. The first line can be printed out when the code is called, and it'll continue on printing the next line when enter is pressed.
