*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by kkwek.*

Description: 
Born2beroot is using a virtual machine to learn about system administration, linux security and basic server configurations.
The goal is to understand how to use a virtual machine and how to configure it as a secure linux system.

Instructions: 

Resources: 




2. Description — keep this SHORT

You do not need to explain everything here.

What to include:

What the project is

What the goal is

That’s it.
1–3 sentences is completely fine.

Example (in your style):

Born2BeRoot is a project that uses a virtual machine to learn about system administration and Linux security.
The goal is to understand how to configure and manage a secure Linux system.

That’s more than enough.

3. Instructions — yes, this is where your thoughts go (with limits)

You are right to think this.

What is okay to put here

✅ Your process

How you set things up

What order you did things in

Important decisions you made

✅ Explanations like:

“I configured SSH to…”

“I set up sudo rules by…”

“A cron job was used to…”

✅ Helpful notes:

Things that confused you

Things someone should be careful about

Why you chose Debian/Rocky

What to avoid

🚫 Don’t write:

“I copied this from X”

“ChatGPT helped me”

Step-by-step commands that violate 42 rules (if applicable)

Instead of “how I got my code,” think:

how I configured my system

Example (very acceptable tone)

First, a Linux virtual machine was installed and configured.
User and group permissions were set up to follow security rules.
SSH and firewall settings were configured to allow secure remote access.
A monitoring script was added to display system information.

That’s not cheating, not too personal, and not too dry.

4. Resources — keep it factual

This is just a list.

You can include:

Linux documentation

Man pages

Tutorials

Articles you used

Example:

Debian documentation

Linux man pages

42 Born2BeRoot subject PDF

No explanations needed here unless you want to add short notes.

5. Very important reassurance 💛

You do not need:

Fancy wording

Long explanations

A “perfect” README

42 reviewers mainly check:

Is it clear?

Is it honest?

Does it show you understand what you did?

Your instinct to keep it simple is correct.
