need to check for the number of things printed for printf, but it doesn't need to be printed, unless asked to, for example in a code like this: int check = simple_printf("hello i am %d years old", 6);



Core Elements Of Printf:

To build a custom printf, you'll need to address several essential components:

1. Format String:

	- The format string tells printf how to display the arguments.

	- It can contain text, along with special format specifiers like %d for integers, %f for floating-point numbers, %s for strings, etc.

	- Example: "The value is: %d and %f"

2. Variable Arguments:

	- printf can accept a variable number of arguments, which are specified after the format string.

	- You'd use C's stdarg.h functions (va_start, va_arg, va_end) to handle this.

3. Format Specifiers:

	- Format specifiers are placeholders in the format string (like %d, %s, %f) that tell printf what type of data to expect and how to format it.

	- You'll need to parse these specifiers and convert the arguments accordingly.

4. Type Handling:

	- Different specifiers represent different types of data: %d for integers, %f for floats, %s for strings, %x for hexadecimal, etc.

	- You'll need to handle each type and convert it to a string representation.

5. Output (Printing):

	- Once the arguments are formatted, they need to be written to the standard output, which is commonly done using the write() system call (or fputs, puts, etc.).
	


Basic Structure of a Custom printf:

When you implement your own version of printf, you need to:

1. Parse the format string:

	- Loop through the string and identify format specifiers (%d, %s, %f, etc.).

2. Process the Arguments:

	- Use va_start to initialize a va_list and access the variable arguments.

	- Use va_arg to retrieve each argument based on the specifier.

3. Handle Conversion:

	- For each specifier, convert the corresponding argument to a string.

	- For example, %d needs to be converted to an integer string, %f needs to be converted to a float string, etc.

4. Write the Output:

	- Output the formatted string using write() or another output function (e.g., fputs()).



High-Level Steps for a Simple printf:

1. Start with parsing the format string.

2. Identify format specifiers (e.g., %d, %s).

3. For each format specifier:

	- Retrieve the corresponding argument using va_arg.

	- Convert the argument to a string if necessary (e.g., itoa for integers, gcvt or sprintf for floats).

4. Output the result:

	- If it's plain text, print it as-is.

	- If it's a formatted argument, print the converted value.

5. Repeat until all specifiers and characters in the format string are processed.



What You'll Need to Implement:

1. Parse the Format String: Detect when a format specifier appears (e.g., %d, %s), and handle it.

2. Convert Data: Depending on the format specifier, convert the corresponding argument to a string (e.g., integer to string, float to string).

3. Write Output: Use write() or similar to print the formatted result to stdout.
