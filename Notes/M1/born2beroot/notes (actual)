1. Operating System:

	- Choose between:

		- Latest stable Debian (recommended for beginners).

		- Latest stable Rocky (more complex).

	- No graphical interface (no X.org, Wayland, or similar).


2. Security:

	- SSH setup:

		- SSH must run on port 4242.

		- Root login via SSH must be disabled.

		- You’ll be asked to configure SSH and create a new user during your review.

	- Firewall:

		- Only port 4242 should be open (UFW for Debian, firewalld for Rocky).

		- Ensure the firewall is active when the VM starts.


3. User and Password Setup:

	- Create a user with your login ending in 42 (e.g., wil42).

	- The user must belong to the user42 and sudo groups.

	- Strong password policy:

		- Passwords expire every 30 days.

		- Minimum 10 characters; must include uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.

		- Passwords cannot contain user’s name or have more than 3 identical consecutive characters.

		- Root password also needs to follow this policy.

	- Configure sudo:

		- Limit 3 incorrect password attempts.

		- Custom error message for failed sudo attempts.

		- Log sudo actions (inputs and outputs) in /var/log/sudo/.

		- Restrict sudo path to: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin.


4. Encryption & Disk Setup:

	- Create at least 2 encrypted partitions using LVM (Logical Volume Management).

	- Choose appropriate disk sizes to avoid waste and ensure good operation.


5. Additional Configurations:

	- SELinux (for Rocky) or AppArmor (for Debian) must be running and configured properly.

	- Set your VM’s hostname to your login name + 42 (e.g., wil42).


6. Bash Script (monitoring.sh):

	- Create a bash script called monitoring.sh to display system information every 10 minutes.

	- Information displayed should include:

		- OS architecture and kernel version.

		- Number of physical and virtual CPUs.

		- Memory and disk usage as a percentage.

		- CPU load.

		- Last reboot time.

		- LVM status (active or not).

		- Number of active connections and users.

		- Server's IPv4 and MAC address.

		- Number of sudo commands executed.

	- The script should run at startup and display the information via wall (used for broadcasting messages).

	- Test the script during peer review, including interrupting it.


7. Important Notes:

	- Peer Review: During the peer review, you'll be asked to explain your configurations, create a new user, and interrupt the script.

	- Ensure the script does not show any errors and works as expected.


Summary of Tasks:

	1. Set up Debian or Rocky without graphical interface.

	2. Disable root login via SSH, enable SSH on port 4242.

	3. Set up the firewall to allow only port 4242.

	4. Create a user with strong password policies.

	5. Configure sudo with restrictions and logging.

	6. Set up encrypted partitions using LVM.

	7. Configure SELinux or AppArmor.

	8. Write and configure a bash script to monitor system information.
