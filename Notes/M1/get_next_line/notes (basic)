🔁 1. “Repeated calls should let you read the file one line at a time”

	If you call get_next_line(fd) again and again, it should give you:

		- first call → the 1st line

		- second call → the 2nd line

		- third call → the 3rd line

		- and so on…

	until there is no more text to read.


📤 2. “Your function should return the line that was read. If nothing is left or there is an error, return NULL.”

	- If your function reads a line → return that line (as a char *)

	- If the file is finished → return NULL

	- If something goes wrong (read error) → return NULL


⌨️ 3. “Your function should work with both a file and standard input.”

	get_next_line() must work when reading:

		- from a file you open with open()

		- from stdin (keyboard input), file descriptor 0

	So you can type text and it should read one line at a time.


↩️ 4. “The returned line should include the newline character \n, except at the end of file.”

		Example file content:

			Hello\n
			World\n
			End


		get_next_line() should return:

		1. "Hello\n"

		2. "World\n"

		3. "End" ← no \n because the file did not end with one


📄 5. “Your header file get_next_line.h must contain the prototype.”

	Your get_next_line.h must have at least:

		char *get_next_line(int fd);


	This tells the compiler the function exists.


🛠️ 6. “Add all helper functions to get_next_line_utils.c”

	If you write small helper functions such as:

	- ft_strlen

	- ft_strchr

	- ft_strjoin

	- etc.

	These must be placed in get_next_line_utils.c.


⭐ In short:

	You must write a function that:

	✔ reads a file line by line
	✔ returns one line per call
	✔ includes the \n when it exists
	✔ returns NULL when done
	✔ works for files and standard input
	✔ uses a header file and a utils file
	
	
	
	✔️ Example in plain English
	
			fd = open("hello.txt", O_RDONLY);


		This does not give you the text.

		It gives you a handle so you can later say:

			read(fd, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);


		and the OS returns chunks of the file.

	get_next_line() simply wraps this process and returns one line at a time.
