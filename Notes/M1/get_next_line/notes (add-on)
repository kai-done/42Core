1. “Because you will have to read files in get_next_line(), add this option: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n”

	Your get_next_line() uses a buffer to read from a file.
	The buffer size must not be hardcoded in your code.

	Instead, when you compile the program, you will choose the size of the buffer:

		cc -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 ...


	This means BUFFER_SIZE = 42 while compiling.


2. “The buffer size value will be adjusted by peer evaluators and Moulinette”

	The testers will compile your code with many different values:

		- BUFFER_SIZE=1

		- BUFFER_SIZE=5

		- BUFFER_SIZE=5000

		- BUFFER_SIZE=100000

	Your code must work with any buffer size.


3. “We must be able to compile with and without the -D BUFFER_SIZE flag”

	That means:

		✔ With the flag:
			cc -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 your_files.c

		✔ Without the flag:
			cc your_files.c


		So you must give BUFFER_SIZE a default value in your header:

			#ifndef BUFFER_SIZE
			# define BUFFER_SIZE 42
			#endif


	If the compiler does not give a value, the code uses 42.


4. Example compiler command

		cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c


	This is exactly how the tester might compile your program.


5. “Undefined behavior if the file is modified while reading it”

	If you are reading a file and someone changes that file at the same time, then:

		- get_next_line() may return weird lines

		- the behavior is not defined

		- you do not need to handle this case

	This is normal — even real programs behave unpredictably if files change mid-read.


6. “Undefined behavior when reading a binary file”

	Binary files (like .png, .mp3, .pdf) contain data that:

		- may not have \n at all

		- may contain weird non-text bytes

		- may contain null bytes (\0) inside

	Your function is not required to work correctly with such files.

	But if you want, you can try to handle them in a logical way — it is optional.


⭐ Very short summary

	- BUFFER_SIZE is chosen when compiling, not inside your code.

	- Testers will try many values — your code must work for all of them.

	- You must provide a default BUFFER_SIZE if no value is given.

	- Changing the file while reading = unpredictable behavior.

	- Reading binary files = unpredictable behavior unless you handle it.
